# Linear VS Polynomial Regression using MPG data

**Linear Regression:**
Linear regression analysis is used to predict the value of a variable based on the value of another variable. The variable you want to predict is called the dependent variable. The variable you are using to predict the other variable's value is called the independent variable.

**Polynomial Regression:** Polynomial Regression is a form of Linear regression known as a special case of Multiple linear regression which estimates the relationship as an nth degree polynomial. Polynomial Regression is sensitive to outliers so the presence of one or two outliers can also badly affect the performance.

**Dataset:** The data is technical spec of cars. The dataset is downloaded from UCI Machine Learning Repository
